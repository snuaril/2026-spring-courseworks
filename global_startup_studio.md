# 글로벌 스타트업 스튜디오
Global Startup Studio

M2177.011400
> This course is linked to the SNU Campus in the World program and selects one of the world’s major innovation hubs. Students form multidisciplinary teams to carry out practical startup projects and receive mentoring and feedback from local alumni, entrepreneurs, and experts. Through these activities, students cultivate problem-solving skills and entrepreneurial mindsets suited to global market environments, while building international business networks through direct engagement with local startup ecosystems. By testing and refining their ideas in diverse cultural and market contexts, students are expected to develop a balanced set of technical competencies, leadership skills, and global perspectives.
