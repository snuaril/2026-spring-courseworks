Solar Car Capstone Design

M2177.011500
> This course is an integrated capstone project in which students from diverse academic backgrounds and areas of expertise form teams todesign, manufacture, and validate a sustainable solar car, with the goal of preparing for participation in international solar car competitions such as the World Solar Challenge, the SASOL Solar Car Challenge, and the American Solar Challenge. The course
combines lectures and technical seminars for theoretical learning with hands-on activities in design, validation, and testing. Based on a thorough analysis of competition regulations, students derive design requirements and carry out corresponding engineering solutions. Through multidisciplinary collaboration, they gain experience in the entire process from concept development to prototyping and performance evaluation, cultivate the ability to assess and present results using engineering, environmental, and economic metrics, and build the technical and organizational foundations necessary for actual competition participation.
