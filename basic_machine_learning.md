# 머신러닝을 위한 기초 수학 및 프로그래밍 실습
Basic Mathematics and Programming Practice for Machine Learning

M2177.005800
> This course aims to develop an understanding of how wise judgment becomes possible in complex phenomena. Students learn how to capture the internal order of phenomena through mathematics and implement it through programming as a sequence of logical procedures. Mathematics is treated as a language for clearly describing complex phenomena, while programming serves as a cognitive tool that translates such descriptions into executable judgment and action. Just as humans perceive the world and make decisions through language, the course explores how language can be modeled as states, probabilities, and decision-making structures, and how these models can be extended into agent-based machine learning systems. Students work with real-world data drawn from natural, industrial, and medical domains, gaining experience in connecting abstract theory to practical problems. In particular, by approaching challenges that are difficult to solve individually through team -based projects with students from diverse academic backgrounds, students experience how different perspectives can be integrated into a coherent judgment structure. The course is open to students of all majors and emphasizes the use of mathematics and programming as tools for structured th inking. Through this course, students are expected to develop the ability to logically analyze and solve complex problems, and to creatively apply mathematical and computational methods to a wide range of real-world challenges.
